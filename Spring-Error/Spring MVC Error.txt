Spring MVC


when 400 error ocure it means whatever parameter name you have written in java class is not matching with assoctiated html parameter...



when you use modelattribute you need to create new model package and class  and create pojo class for given html parameter you want to add like requestbody

name of parameter should be always same in both side
